## Projects
* [Stochastic Noise Reduction in Basketball Analytics](https://github.com/brycepyburn/reducing-stochastic-noise)
  * Developed a shot quality metric to reduce variance in traditional performance evaluation metrics.
* [A Probabilistic Analysis of Rank-Order Ties in a 4-Player Dice Game](https://github.com/brycepyburn/dice-game-probability)
  * Solved probability problem analytically and confirmed solution via Monte Carlo simulation.
* [A Probabilistic Analysis of Successful Completion of a "Flip" Game](https://github.com/brycepyburn/flip-game-probability)
  * Utilized Monte Carlo simulation to approximate probability.
* [Bayesian Blackjack Engine](https://github.com/brycepyburn/python-blackjack-engine)
  * Built a one-step look-ahead policy heuristic to achieve top engine-level win rates at reduced computational load.
* Failed Conjecture Linking Chord Number and Outcome Class in Graph Theoretical Representations of Pursuit Evasion Games (coming soon)
 * Collaboration with former Graph Theory professor. Disproof via counterexample.
<!-- Add in Connect 4, Hearts. Then add in game review features for each -->
